# movieworld
Movie World project

# Setup
1. Add your AWS credentials as server environment variables (aws_access_key_id, aws_secret_access_key).
2. Build the project "mvn install". It should create all the required tables.
3. All the movie data is stored in AWS S3 as json file. Use the "/setup - POST" endpoint to create movies data. Once you hit the POST endpoint, you will be given a status of your data setup request. The user should use GET on '/setup/{id}' to check the status. Once the status changes to COMPLETE, the data is ready.
4. For API documentation use swagger UI -- "http://host:port/movieworld/swagger-ui.html".
